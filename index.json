My mission was essentially to perform some taxonomic analyses of metagenomes and show how a metagenome generated in our lab related to these. So, naturally, I said yes, carried out the necessary analyses and proceeded to design a figure to show the result. I figured a dendrogram would be a nice way of showing compositional similarity between the community we studied and other communities. First of all, I set about creating a distance matrix and plotting the dendrogram like so:\nlibrary(vegan) ## Loading required package: permute ## Loading required package: lattice ## This is vegan 2.5-3 data(dune) # load some dummy data commDist \u0026lt;- vegdist(dune, \u0026quot;jaccard\u0026quot;) # calculate the community similarity distance matrix plot(hclust(commDist)) There you go. It’s easy to generate a basic dendrogram using any sort of distance matrix. So I then started tidying it up to make it a bit more presentable.\nsiteLabels \u0026lt;- paste(\u0026quot;Sample \u0026quot;, rownames(dune), sep = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;) # create some sample labels plot(hclust(commDist), labels = siteLabels, main = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;, sub = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;, xlab = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;, ylab = \u0026quot;Jaccard Similarity\u0026quot;, lwd = 2, cex = 1.2) Much nicer! We’ve gotten rid of the nonsense at the bottom, given a more informative y axis label and generally made things ‘nicer’. Except, when I saw the first draft, I saw my supervisor had rotated the plot so that the leaf tips pointed to the left. For some reason this just looked wrong to my eyes and so I opted to replot the dendrogram, in a more sensible orientation.\nNote that to do this, we have to change our approach slightly. For some stupid reason, when we want to plot a dendrogram horizontally, we have to coerce the hclust output to dendrogram class. Additionally, the ‘plot’ method for a dendrogram class object no longer accepts the labels parameter, so we must rename the rows of our dataframe and recalculate the distance matrix instead.\nrownames(dune) \u0026lt;- siteLabels # rename rows of dataframe with our sample labels created earlier commDist \u0026lt;- vegdist(dune, \u0026quot;jaccard\u0026quot;) # recalculate the distance matrix so that it features our new sample names par(mar = c(5, 1, 1, 5)) # adjust margins to make room for tip labels # replot the dendrogram, note that we can now remove the \u0026quot;main =\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;sub =\u0026quot; arguments # also remember to switch the x and y labels! plot(as.dendrogram(hclust(commDist)), xlab = \u0026quot;Jaccard Similarity\u0026quot;, lwd = 2, cex = 1.2, horiz = T) Perfect! Or at least I thought so. Turns out my supervisor liked the improved orientation but didn’t like the way the branches all ended at the same point. That should be easy to correct right? Wrong!\nI spent near enough an entire day trying to get this plot perfect without success. I went as far as exploring the ggdendro package which allows plotting of dendrograms in a ggplot-esque manner.\nThen I stumbled on a solution, enter dendextend! A quick peek of the package manual reveals some really awesome capabilities, I really urge you to take a look as some of the figures you can create are amazing.

As far as I am aware, adonis is simply the name of the function that carries out a permutational MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance) or non-parametric MANOVA as the original author of this statistical test calls it (Anderson, 2001).\nA quick google search appears to suggest that one potential difference might be that the statistical test carried out by the adonis() function is capable of handling both categoric and continuous predictors. In contrast, non-parametric MANOVA is only able to handle categoric predictors. This difference sort of makes sense, but I’m still not convinced that we should be using the term “adonis test”.\nI was also interested to see how many microbial ecology studies actually refer to this so called “adonis test” to see whether we are to blame for this confusion. I conducted a highly rigorous and robust google scholar search (yep, really!) on the terms “adonis test” and “adonis test” + microb* and limited results from 2001-present.\nAs it turns out, 84% of the studies that mention “adonis test” also feature the word “microb*“, suggesting that we might be to blame! Also, only 11 of these studies used the term”MANOVA“, suggesting that the vast majority did not elaborate on the statistical procedure initiated by the adonis function.\nIf I’m completely wrong on this and there is such a thing as an adonis test then please do tell me.

For archaeal or bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences this is relatively easy. The Ribosomal Database Project have a naive Bayesian classifier which is trained on a large curated database of archaeal and bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences. Best of all, it is implemented in the popular bioinformatics pipeline Qiime, making it nice and easy to apply to your own data.\nBut what if you are for dealing with fungal ITS sequences instead? Well a recent paper from Deshpande et al piqued my interest for several reasons. The paper describes a new curated database of fungal ITS sequences and demonstrates that the RDP naive Bayesian classifier does a decent job of classifying ITS sequences when trained on this database.\nUnfortunately, using the RDP classifier on ITS sequences means going off piste so to speak and using the standalone classifier outside of Qiime. Given that most people never use the classifier outside of Qiime, I thought a brief demonstration might be useful. For all of the following, I’m assuming you’re using BioLinux and are at least somewhat familiar with the Linux terminal.\nFirst of all, clone the RDPtools github repo like so:\ngit clone https://github.com/rdpstaff/RDPTools.git Then, enter the newly created directory and set up the RDPtools software:\ncd RDPTools git submodule init git submodule updat make You’ll get a lot of text whizzing through the terminal, don’t worry, you haven’t yet entered the Matrix! Once these processes finish the classifier has installed and is ready for use. However, we must now download some additional files which will allow the classifier to classify our fungal ITS sequences. To download these files, type:\nwget \u0026quot;http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/download/rdpclassifiertraindata/data.tgz\u0026quot; This may take a few minutes depending on your connection speed. The files are packaged in what we call a tarball (kind of like a windows zip folder). To unpack them:\ntar -zxvf data.tgz Now when we list the contents of our directory, we can see a new directory, “data”, has been created. This folder contains all the files we need to use the Warcup based classifier (and also the UNITE and LSU data handily).\nI’m going to assume you’ve already clustered your ITS sequences into operational taxonomic units and picked a representative sequence for each OTU using Qiime or other means.\nNow we simply call the classifier, tell it to use the Warcup classification files, and tell it where out data is. Simple:\njava -Xmx1g -jar classifier.jar classify -t data/classifier/fungalits_warcup/rRNAClassifier.properties -o classifiedFungi.txt /path/to/data/fungalITS_repSet.fasta A new file (“classifiedFungi.txt”) will have been created, containing the taxonomic assignments of each fungal sequence, complete with confidence values, pretty cool! You can of course train the classifier yourself on a custom database, in which case, follow the steps here Anyway, I hope this was useful and demonstrates that venturing outside of Qiime is not necessarily that difficult!\n","date":1544572800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544572800,"objectID":"692844bc2d09446da26b5c80481ac924","permalink":"https://Dave-Clark.github.io/post/know-your-fungi-a-brief-demo-of-the-new-fungal-classifier/","publishdate":"2018-12-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/know-your-fungi-a-brief-demo-of-the-new-fungal-classifier/","section":"post","summary":"As a microbial ecologist, part of my job is to try and assign taxonomy to all of the microbial critters living in the habitats I study.
