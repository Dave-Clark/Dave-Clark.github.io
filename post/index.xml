      <title>Speeding up rarefaction curves for microbial community ecology</title>

      <description>When beginning analyses on microbial community data, it is often helpful to compute rarefaction curves. A rarefaction curve tells you about the rate at which new species/OTUs are detected as you increase the number of individuals/sequences sampled. It does this by taking random subsamples from 1, up to the size of your sample, and computing the number of species present in each subsample. Ideally, you want your rarefaction curves to be relatively flat, as this indicates that additional sampling would not likely yield further species.</description>

      <title>Zoomed maps with ggforce!</title>

      <description>I was recently asked via twitter to share some code on how I implemented the facet_zoom() function, from the newly released ggforce package, to zoom in on a particular region of a map. I’ve no idea if this is the “best” way of creating these sorts of maps, but anyway, here goes…
This way of making maps requires a number of packages, so make sure you have these installed first, then load them like so…</description>

      <title>ggplot2; From default to delightful</title>

      <description>If you use R to analyse and plot your data, then you’ve probably heard of and used the ggplot2 package, written by Hadley Wickham. ggplot2 is a highly flexible plotting package allowing you to create just about any kind of plot you can think of, and customise just about any aspect of your plot.
However, ggplot2 is also known for it’s somewhat strange choice of default options (at least, they seem strange to me!</description>

      <description>I was recently asked by one of my PhD supervisors to help out on a paper by doing some metagenomic analyses. My mission was essentially to perform some taxonomic analyses of metagenomes and show how a metagenome generated in our lab related to these. So, naturally, I said yes, carried out the necessary analyses and proceeded to design a figure to show the result. I figured a dendrogram would be a nice way of showing compositional similarity between the community we studied and other communities.</description>

      <title>Does the Adonis test really exist?</title>

      <description>I’ve recently started a chapter for my PhD which involves a meta-analysis of microbial ecological literature. This has involved looking through the methods, or more specifically the stats sections, of lots of studies to see whether they are suitable for inclusion in my analysis. One idiosyncracy I noted whilst doing this is the number of studies that refer to an “Adonis test”. As far as I am aware, adonis is simply the name of the function that carries out a permutational MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance) or non-parametric MANOVA as the original author of this statistical test calls it (Anderson, 2001).</description>

      <description>As a microbial ecologist, part of my job is to try and assign taxonomy to all of the microbial critters living in the habitats I study. For archaeal or bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences this is relatively easy. The Ribosomal Database Project have a naive Bayesian classifier which is trained on a large curated database of archaeal and bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences. Best of all, it is implemented in the popular bioinformatics pipeline Qiime, making it nice and easy to apply to your own data.</description>

      <title>Merging Taxonomy With Non-Qiime OTU Tables</title>
      <link>https://Dave-Clark.github.io/post/merging-taxonomy-with-non-qiime-otu-tables/</link>

      <description>This is a quick post more to document some useful code than anything else. When conducting bioinformatic analyses using Qiime, one of the last steps is to cluster sequences into OTUs (operational taxonomic units) and assign taxonomy to them. You can then make an OTU table which contains all your OTUs and their associated taxonomy. Bam, easy!
But what to do if you haven’t/don’t want to use Qiime to cluster OTUs?</description>
